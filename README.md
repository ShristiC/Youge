# Youge

Youge - Where the Old can reconnect with their youthful days. 


An app developed on flutter designed to help old people. 

## Idea

A platform designed to be the central place for older people. It will help older people 
- relearn and complete tasks
- call a volunteer for additional help
- have calendar reminders, as well as be able to go through old memories 
- connect with other users via messaging and calling 

The app will eventually be accessible by volunteer helpers, Youge members, and caretakers / guardians to interconnectedly interact with each other and help bring the old into a youthful age. 

### Features

- Tutorials: videos, image sequences, and text
- Call a Volunteer: similar to the volunteer set up with "Be my Eyes" assistive tech app 
- Integrated Calendar and Reminder System
- Avenue to explore older memories and reconnect with past years (helping with memory loss)
- Inter-user interaction : calling and messaging among users, with a fun aspect of avatar creation 


## Getting Started
- to run the app
  - "flutter run" in the terminal assuming all of the setup has been done
